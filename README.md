# Telegram channel for Claude Code

Talk to a running Claude Code session from Telegram — and let Claude talk back.
This plugin bridges a Telegram bot to your Claude Code session so you can drive
work from your phone: send messages and files, get replies with native
formatting, approve permission prompts with a tap, switch modes, and interrupt a
running task.

It ships built-in access control (pairing, allowlists, group policy), so only
people you approve can reach your session.

> **Running without the MCP server (off-MCP mode):** the bridge can drive a
> plugin-less Claude session so it doesn't pay the per-request MCP context tax —
> inbound is typed into the pane, replies are read back from the transcript, and a
> `tg` CLI handles file-send/react/edit. To set it up (or have a fresh Claude
> install it), see **[`off-mcp/INSTALL.md`](./off-mcp/INSTALL.md)**.

## Install

**Let Claude do it.** Clone this repo, open a Claude Code session in it, and say
*"set up the Telegram bridge."* The repo's [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) tells Claude to follow
[`off-mcp/INSTALL.md`](./off-mcp/INSTALL.md) — it interviews you for the bot token, your
Telegram ID, and a few options, writes the config, installs the plugin + a self-healing
daemon hook, and gets you to a working session. The only things it can't do itself are
getting the bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and the single Claude Code
restart.

```sh
gh repo clone salqrazy/better-claude-telegram   # private/preview: uses your gh auth
cd better-claude-telegram && claude              # then: "set up the Telegram bridge"
```

> While the repo is private, `git clone` over HTTPS fails with `could not read Username`. Use
> `gh repo clone` (authenticated), or an SSH remote, instead.

Prefer to do it by hand? [`off-mcp/INSTALL.md`](./off-mcp/INSTALL.md) lists every step.

## Features

- **Two-way messaging** — your Telegram messages reach Claude; Claude replies
  back over the bot.
- **Native Markdown rendering** — Claude writes normal Markdown (`**bold**`,
  `` `code` ``, fenced blocks, lists, links); it renders as native Telegram
  formatting. Toggle off per-config or per-message. See
  [`ACCESS.md`](./ACCESS.md).
- **Access control** — DM pairing with one-time codes, allowlists, and per-group
  policy with mention-triggering. Allowlist-first by design. See
  [`ACCESS.md`](./ACCESS.md).
- **Permission prompts** — when Claude needs approval for a tool call, you get an
  inline-keyboard Allow/Deny right in the chat. When a turn stacks up several prompts,
  a one-tap **"⚡ Allow all this turn"** card answers the rest of that turn for you
  (scoped to the turn, not bypass; toggle in `/settings`).
- **Mode switching** — change permission mode from Telegram: `/plan`, `/auto`,
  `/default`, `/acceptedits`, `/bypass`, or the interactive `/mode`.
- **Interrupt** — `/stop` sends Esc to the session, cancelling the current turn.
- **Ship the work** — `/diff` shows uncommitted changes; an opt-in setting (🚢 Ship buttons)
  posts a "📝 N files changed" footer after turns with Diff / Commit / Push / PR buttons, so
  review-gated landing works from the phone. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for what's next.
- **Multi-account** — register extra Claude accounts (during setup or `/account add work`)
  and launch sessions on any of them straight from Telegram (/settings → 👤 Accounts → 🚀;
  the one-time login link relays into the chat). Some chats on one account, some on another —
  usage limits, auto-continue, and `/resume` track each account separately.
- **Attachments** — send photos and documents in; Claude can attach files back.
- **Voice & audio transcription** — inbound voice/audio notes are transcribed
  to text before they reach Claude, via a local Whisper model or a hosted API
  (Groq / OpenAI). Runs entirely outside Claude, so it never consumes usage. Pick
  the backend and (for local) the Whisper model right from `/settings`.
- **Reasoning effort** — set Claude's thinking effort from Telegram with `/effort`
  (low · medium · high · max); the current level shows on the `/status` card.
- **Scheduled messages** — one-shot (`/schedule 12h ping the server`) or recurring
  (`/schedule every 09:00 …`, `every weekday 09:00`, `every mon 09:00`) in your own
  timezone (`/schedule tz`); recurring entries re-arm after each delivery.
- **Queue for idle & limit reset** — `/queue <prompt>` runs when the session next goes
  idle; `/queue @reset <prompt>` holds it until the 5h usage window rolls over, so dead
  limit hours soak up queued work.
- **Voice replies (TTS)** — Claude's replies can arrive as voice notes too: free local
  Piper (auto-installed with ffmpeg, 5 curated voices to pick from) or hosted OpenAI /
  ElevenLabs. Modes off · digest-only · all (`/voice on|off`; details in `/settings`).
  Speaks text Claude already wrote — zero extra usage.
- **Edit to correct** — edit your most recent Telegram message and the session receives
  it as a correction replacing the original.
- **Multiple sessions via group topics** — bind a forum supergroup with `/bind` and
  every Claude Code session gets its own topic (tab): type in a topic to drive that
  session, create a topic to spawn a new session in any folder — or, when the anchor
  folder is a git repo, in an isolated **git worktree** (`<repo>-wt/<name>` on branch
  `tg/<name>`, auto-removed on topic close when clean) so parallel sessions on one repo
  never collide. The DM drives a single session.
- **Pinned status card** — a self-updating pinned message (per DM, and per topic in group
  mode) with the live model · mode · context · usage-limit metrics plus ⚙️ Settings /
  🧠 Model / 🕹️ Mode quick buttons. `/status` re-posts it at the bottom.
- **Live activity mirror** — a single self-updating message shows what Claude is doing
  in real time (💻 terminal, 📋 todo, 📖 read, ✏️ edit, 🔍 search, 🤖 agent, ❓ clarify…),
  read straight from the transcript so it costs zero usage. On by default; choose its
  style with `/stream` (thoughts · tools · hybrid · off). The pinned card also shows the
  session's working plan (📋 done/total · current step).
- **Self-maintenance** — `/health` shows the bridge's vitals (instance, version, uptime,
  panes, queues, watchdog, last crash); a daily check posts a quiet "🆕 Update available"
  card with one-tap buttons to update the bridge or Claude itself (never auto-applies;
  `/update` does the same on demand).

## How it works

```
Telegram  ⇄  daemon.ts  ⇄  shim.ts (MCP server)  ⇄  Claude Code session
              (grammy bot,        (the tools Claude
               long-lived)         calls: reply, react, …)
```

- **`shim.ts`** is the MCP server your Claude session talks to. It exposes the
  `reply`, `react`, `download_attachment`, and `edit_message` tools and forwards
  each call to the daemon over a local socket.
- **`daemon.ts`** is a long-lived process that owns the Telegram bot connection.
  It outlives individual Claude sessions (and survives `/reload-plugins`),
  enforces the access gate on every inbound message, and watches the session's
  tmux pane to detect prompts and relay slash commands.
- **`common.ts`** holds the shared wire protocol and state-dir paths;
  **`markdown.ts`** holds the Markdown→Telegram-HTML converter and the
  chunk-safe splitter.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (the runtime; dependencies install on first launch).
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- `tmux` — required for mode switching and `/stop` (the daemon reads/controls the
  session pane). Core messaging works without it.
- Optional, for local voice transcription: `faster-whisper` (a venv is fine).

### Platform support

- **Linux** — fully supported.
- **macOS** — fully supported (off-MCP pane discovery reads process args via `ps`
  where there's no `/proc`).
- **Windows** — via **[WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/)** only; it's a
  real Linux environment, so everything works as on Linux. Native Windows is not
  supported (no `tmux`, which the daemon relies on to drive the session pane).

## Install

This is a Claude Code plugin. Add it and install:

```
/plugin marketplace add salqrazy/better-claude-telegram
/plugin install telegram@better-claude-plugins
```

(The `marketplace add` argument is the repo path — update it if you rename the
repo. The `@better-claude-plugins` suffix is the marketplace name from
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and is independent of the repo name.)

## Launch

Channels are a research-preview feature, and only channels from the official
`claude-plugins-official` marketplace are on Claude Code's approved allowlist. A
custom channel like this one is blocked until you load it explicitly — otherwise
you'll see `plugin:telegram@better-claude-plugins • not on the approved channels
allowlist`. Launch Claude Code with the development flag (requires Claude Code
v2.1.80+):

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:telegram@better-claude-plugins
```

That loads and activates the channel for the session (after a one-time
confirmation prompt). To also skip per-tool permission prompts, add
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`:

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:telegram@better-claude-plugins --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Since you'll run this every session, add an alias. Either drop it in your shell
rc by hand:

```bash
alias claude-tg='claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:telegram@better-claude-plugins --dangerously-skip-permissions'
```

…or run the bundled one-time setup script, which appends that alias to your
`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` (idempotently):

```bash
bash scripts/setup-alias.sh mcp
```

Then reload your shell (or `source` the rc) and launch with `claude-tg`. (For the off-MCP
default instead, `bash scripts/setup-alias.sh` adds a `claude-tg` shell function —
`tmux set -p @tg_bridge "${1:-1}"; claude --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` — where the
`@tg_bridge` tmux pane option (valued by instance slot) is the daemon's bridge marker (decoupled
from claude's args); this starts in a normal mode (prompts relay to Telegram) with bypass switchable
on demand from `/mode`, and `claude-tg N` routes to a second bridge. A second arg pins the
session to another Claude **account**: `claude-tg 1 work` launches under
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work` — see `/account`.)

> Note: `/plugin install` can't add the alias for you — plugins are copied to a
> cache and don't run host-shell install scripts. The setup script above is the
> closest one-step equivalent.

## Setup

All setup happens from your Claude Code session via the bundled skills.

1. **Create a bot** with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token.
2. **Save the token:**
   ```
   /telegram:configure <token>
   ```
3. **Pair yourself:** DM your bot anything on Telegram. It replies with a 6-char
   code. Approve it:
   ```
   /telegram:access pair <code>
   ```
   Now your DMs reach the session.
4. **Lock it down** (recommended) once your allowlist is set:
   ```
   /telegram:access policy allowlist
   ```
5. **(Optional) Voice transcription:**
   ```
   /telegram:configure transcribe local      # or: groq | openai | off
   ```

Run `/telegram:configure` with no arguments any time for a status overview and
the recommended next step.

## Usage

Once paired, just message your bot — text goes to Claude, and replies come back
formatted. Bot commands:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/start` | Welcome + full feature guide (and pairing steps if not paired) |
| `/status` | Re-post the pinned status card at the bottom; pairing state if unpaired |
| `/account` | Claude accounts — list, `add <name>`, `remove <name>` (multi-account) |
| `/find <text>` | Search every session's conversation; tap a hit to resume |
| `/queue <prompt>` | Per-session backlog — runs when the session goes idle (`/queue clear`) |
| `/digest` | All-sessions digest now, or daily (`/digest 08:00` · `off`) |
| `/budget` | Daily $ cap with 80%/100% warnings (`/budget 20` · `off`) |
| `/rewind` | Open Claude Code's checkpoint picker as tappable buttons |
| `/resume` | List recent sessions with last-activity times; tap one to relaunch (`claude --resume`) |
| `/mode` | Interactive permission-mode switcher (`/mode <name>` jumps straight to one) |
| `/plan` `/auto` `/default` `/acceptedits` `/bypass` | Quick mode switch |
| `/model` | Show the current model (or `/model <name>` to switch) |
| `/effort` | Reasoning effort — picker, or `/effort low\|medium\|high\|max` |
| `/stop` | Interrupt the current task (sends Esc) |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation in the session |
| `/compact` | Compact the conversation to free up context |
| `/cost` | Usage & cost breakdown |
| `/context` | Token-context usage |
| `/stream` | Live-activity card style: `thoughts` · `tools` · `hybrid` · `off` |
| `/diff` | The session's uncommitted changes — stat + chunked patch |
| `/terminal [N]` | Show recent terminal activity (N lines) |
| `/schedule` | Queue a message into a session for later (`/schedule 12h` · `/schedule cancel`) |
| `/pin` | Toggle the pinned status message (`/pin on` \| `off` \| `refresh`) |
| `/settings` | Channel settings panel — live mirror, pin, MCP mode, voice transcription |
| `/reply <response>` | Type a response into the session, then Enter (e.g. a `/login` code) |

Any other `/slash` command is relayed straight to Claude Code. Photos and
documents you send are made available to Claude to read.

When a flow like `/login` prints a sign-in URL, the bot relays it as a tappable
link; open it, then **reply to that message** with the code (or use `/reply <code>`)
to feed it back into the session.

## Configuration

Access policy and delivery/UX settings live in
`~/.claude/channels/telegram/access.json`, managed by `/telegram:access` and
re-read live on each message. Keys include `dmPolicy`, allowlists, group policy,
`ackReaction`, `replyToMode`, `textChunkLimit`, `chunkMode`, `renderMarkdown`, and
`terminalMirror` (the live activity feed — `"tools"` by default, `"digest"`, or
`"off"`). Full reference: [`ACCESS.md`](./ACCESS.md).

The bot token and transcription settings live in
`~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env` (kept `chmod 600`), managed by
`/telegram:configure`.

### Bang shell (`!cmd`) — opt-in, off by default

Set `TELEGRAM_BANG_SHELL=1` in `.env` to let an inbound message that starts with `!`
run as a **shell command on the host** (in the focused session's cwd), with stdout/stderr
relayed back — like Claude Code's terminal `!` REPL, e.g. `!git status`. It runs directly
in the daemon, so it works even while Claude is mid-task. **This is remote code execution
from a chat app:** every allowlisted sender (and anyone who compromises the bot token or an
allowlisted account) can run arbitrary commands. It stays gated by the access allowlist, but
treat enabling it as widening trust. Leave it unset to disable (then `!`-messages are just
normal messages to Claude).

## Upgrading

The daemon is long-lived and deliberately survives Claude sessions, so installing
new plugin code doesn't replace the *running* process on its own. To avoid stale
behavior after an upgrade, the shim fingerprints the plugin's source on connect:
if the running daemon started on different code, the shim restarts it
automatically (it `SIGTERM`s the old daemon and respawns from the new code on the
next connect). **So a normal upgrade — update the plugin, start a session — just
works; no manual daemon kill needed.**

The one exception is a **bot-token** change: the token lives in `.env`, not in the
code, so it doesn't move the fingerprint. Apply a token change with the restart
documented in `/telegram:configure` (restart the session, or
`kill "$(cat ~/.claude/channels/telegram/daemon.pid)"`).

## Uninstalling

Run `/telegram:configure uninstall` for a guided teardown. It stops the
long-lived daemon and (if you ask for a full reset) removes the channel state
in `~/.claude/channels/telegram/` — the bot token, allowlist, and pairings.
Keep that state instead if you're just reinstalling/upgrading and want to stay
paired. The skill then prints the plugin-removal commands it can't run itself:

```
/plugin uninstall telegram@better-claude-plugins
/plugin marketplace remove better-claude-plugins
```

Plugins are cached, so to guarantee a fresh fetch on reinstall, also clear
`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/better-claude-plugins` and
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/better-claude-plugins`, then re-add the marketplace and
reinstall. Restart Claude Code to apply.

## Security

- Secrets (`.env`) are written `0600` and never echoed back in full.
- Replies can't exfiltrate the channel's own state directory (`assertSendable`).
- The skills will only act on requests from your **terminal session**, never
  from an inbound Telegram message — that boundary is what stops a
  prompt-injected message from reconfiguring access or leaking the token.
- Default policy is `pairing`; the setup flow pushes you toward a locked-down
  `allowlist`.
