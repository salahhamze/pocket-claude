This plugin bridges a Telegram bot to your Claude Code session once,then gives you complete CLI control from your phone with the ability to create and manage multiple sessions instantly thanks to tmux. 

Send messages and files, voice notes, use slash commands, see Claude's thought process as it works, approve permission prompts, answer questions, change settings, and more. 

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (the runtime; dependencies install on first launch).
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- `tmux` — required for mode switching and `/stop` (the daemon reads/controls the
  session pane). Core messaging works without it via MCP.

## Installation: 

Just point Claude Code at this repo and tell it to install it. It will install any dependencies if missing and walk you through setup. 


## Launch

The installer adds the alias pocket-claude, which runs Claude with the identifier for the daemon to pick up the session. After going through the initial install, run the alias inside a tmux session, then send a message to the Telegram bot.

For multi-session support, add the Telegram bot as admin in a Telegram group with topics enabled and send /bind in the general chat. You're all set. 

## Usage

Once paired, just message your bot — text goes to Claude, and replies come back
formatted. Bot commands:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/start` | Welcome + full feature guide (and pairing steps if not paired) |
| `/status` | Re-post the pinned status card at the bottom; pairing state if unpaired |
| `/account` | Claude accounts — list, `add <name>`, `remove <name>` (multi-account) |
| `/find <text>` | Search every session's conversation; tap a hit to resume |
| `/queue <prompt>` | Per-session backlog — runs when the session goes idle (`/queue clear`) |
| `/loop <goal>` | Re-run a goal until its check passes (`status` · `stop` · `stop now` · `resume`) |
| `/budget` | Daily $ cap with 80%/100% warnings (`/budget 20` · `off`) |
| `/rewind` | Open Claude Code's checkpoint picker as tappable buttons |
| `/resume` | List recent sessions with last-activity times; tap one to relaunch (`claude --resume`) |
| `/mode` | Interactive permission-mode switcher (`/mode <name>` jumps straight to one) |
| `/plan` `/auto` `/default` `/acceptedits` `/bypass` | Quick mode switch |
| `/model` | Show the current model (or `/model <name>` to switch) |
| `/effort` | Reasoning effort — picker, or `/effort low\|medium\|high\|max` |
| `/stop` | Interrupt the current task (sends Esc) |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation in the session |
| `/compact` | Compact the conversation to free up context |
| `/cost` | Usage & cost breakdown |
| `/context` | Token-context usage |
| `/stream` | Live-activity card style: `thoughts` · `tools` · `hybrid` · `off` |
| `/diff` | The session's uncommitted changes — stat + chunked patch |
| `/terminal [N]` | Show recent terminal activity (N lines) |
| `/schedule` | Queue a message into a session for later (`/schedule 12h` · `/schedule cancel`) |
| `/pin` | Toggle the pinned status message (`/pin on` \| `off` \| `refresh`) |
| `/settings` | Channel settings panel — live mirror, pin, MCP mode, voice transcription |
| `/reply <response>` | Type a response into the session, then Enter (e.g. a `/login` code) |

Any other `/slash` command is relayed straight to Claude Code.
