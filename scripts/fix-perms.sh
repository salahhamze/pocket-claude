# Renormalize this repo's permissions so BOTH users sharing it (suchag + salqrazy) can read,
# edit, commit, and push without tripping over owner-only files.
#
# Why this exists: the two accounts are in each other's groups and the repo is group-owned by a
# shared group with setgid dirs + `git config core.sharedRepository=group` + umask 002 — so normal
# file creation is already group-writable (664). The thing that breaks it is a session that
# *explicitly* chmods tracked files to restrictive modes (600/444/464); those then can't be read or
# overwritten by the other user, and `bun run deploy`'s file copy aborts on the unreadable ones.
#
# This script re-establishes the invariant: dirs = setgid + group-writable, files = group-rw +
# world-r, execute bits preserved, group set to the shared group. Idempotent — safe to re-run.
#
#   sudo bash scripts/fix-perms.sh        # run from anywhere; resolves the repo from its own path
#
# It needs sudo only because it touches files the *other* user owns; ownership itself is left alone
# (the shared group + group perms are what grant access, not the owner).
