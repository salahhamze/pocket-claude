# Install troubleshooting log

Real issues hit installing this bridge on a fresh machine, with root cause, the workaround
used, and a suggested repo-side fix. Off-MCP mode, Linux aarch64, bun 1.3.14, Claude Code
2.1.168, Python 3.12 (PEP 668 externally-managed), tmux 3.4.

State dir: `~/.claude/channels/telegram/` · plugin cache:
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/better-claude-plugins/telegram/0.0.6/`

---

## 1. Private repo — `git clone` over HTTPS fails
**Symptom:** `git clone https://github.com/...` → `fatal: could not read Username for
'https://github.com'`.
**Cause:** repo is private; plain git has no credentials.
**Fix:** `gh repo clone salqrazy/better-claude-telegram` (uses the authenticated `gh` token).
**Repo idea:** note the `gh` clone in the README for private/preview installs.

## 2. Stale/partial plugin cache → grammy `EACCES` (the big one)
**Symptom:** daemon launches then dies immediately. `daemon.log`:
`error: EACCES while resolving package 'debug' from
'~/.bun/install/cache/grammy@1.43.0@@@1/out/platform.node.js'`. Reproducible, not a race.
**Cause chain:**
- The plugin cache dir held only the `.ts` files — **no `package.json`, `bun.lock`, or
  `node_modules`** (a partial copy).
- `ensure-daemon.ts` launches the daemon with `spawn('bun', [daemonPath])` — **no `bun install`
  step**. So `bun daemon.ts` relies on bun's on-the-fly auto-install.
- With no lockfile present, auto-install resolved `grammy: ^1.21.0` to the **latest, 1.43.0**,
  which fails `require("debug")` resolution under bun with `EACCES` (all files were readable —
  it's a bun resolution bug for that grammy build, not a real permission wall).
**Fix:** copy `package.json` + `bun.lock` into the cache version dir and run `bun install`
there. The lockfile pins grammy **1.41.1**, which resolves cleanly. After that the daemon
starts and logs `polling as @<bot>`.
**Repo fix (recommended):** make `ensure-daemon` run `bun install` before launch (mirror the
`package.json` `start` script: `bun install --no-summary && bun shim.ts`), and/or ship a
lockfile-pinned `node_modules` in the plugin package. Optionally pin grammy tighter until the
1.43.0 + bun `debug` resolution is understood.

## 3. Off-MCP bootstrap deadlock (daemon never starts on a clean install)
**Symptom:** after restart, nothing brings the daemon up; `tg` never appears.
**Cause:** the `SessionStart` hook runs `~/.claude/channels/telegram/ensure-daemon.js`, but that
launcher is only written by the daemon **on its first run** (`daemon.ts`
`provisionOffMcpTooling`, ~line 798). In pure off-MCP nothing else spawns the daemon first, so
on a clean install the hook no-ops (file absent) and the daemon never starts — chicken-and-egg.
**Fix:** pre-write the state-dir `ensure-daemon.js` from the daemon's own template (it globs the
cache for `ensure-daemon.ts` at runtime, so it's version-independent). Then the first hook fire
finds the cache and spawns the daemon, which idempotently rewrites the same file.
**Repo fix:** have `off-mcp/INSTALL.md` step 2 write the launcher, or ship it, or point the hook
directly at the cache's `ensure-daemon.ts`.

## 4. Local Whisper on a PEP 668 (externally-managed) Python
**Symptom:** `pip install faster-whisper` would be refused on the system Python.
**Cause:** Python 3.12 marks the env externally-managed (PEP 668).
**Fix:** matched the daemon's own fallback (`provisionWhisper`, ~line 2705): created a venv at
`STATE_DIR/whisper-venv`, installed `faster-whisper` there, and recorded
`TELEGRAM_WHISPER_PYTHON=<venv>/bin/python` in `.env` (daemon checks this path in
`whisperReady`). Verified `import faster_whisper` (1.2.1). Model large-v3-turbo, cpu, int8.
**Repo note:** the daemon already auto-installs on first voice note; pre-provisioning just avoids
the first-use delay. Working as designed — documented here for completeness.

## 5. `scripts/setup-alias.sh` adds the wrong alias for off-MCP
**Symptom:** the bundled alias script writes
`alias claude-tg='claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:telegram@... --dangerously-skip-permissions'`.
**Cause:** that's the **MCP/channel-load** launcher, not the off-MCP one.
**Fix:** for off-MCP the alias is `alias claude-tg='claude --strict-mcp-config'` (added to
`~/.bashrc` manually).
**Repo fix:** make `setup-alias.sh` mode-aware (off-MCP vs MCP), or document both aliases.

## 6. Inbound delivery needs a `--strict-mcp-config` tmux pane (most common "it's not working")
**Symptom:** bot is paired and polling, but Telegram messages never reach a Claude session.
**Cause:** off-MCP delivers inbound by **typing into a tmux pane**. The daemon auto-discovers a
pane only if its `claude` process argv contains `--strict-mcp-config` (`isPluginlessClaude`,
`daemon.ts` ~line 1126). A plain `claude` pane, or a Claude session **not running inside tmux**,
is never adopted — so there's nowhere to deliver.
**Extra gotcha:** spawning `claude --strict-mcp-config` **detached** (e.g. `tmux new-session -d`)
lands on the **first-run theme picker / onboarding**, which blocks the chat prompt; a detached
spawn can't get past it, so the pane is never drivable.
**Fix:** launch the work session **interactively** in tmux and complete onboarding once:
```sh
source ~/.bashrc        # load the claude-tg alias
tmux new -s tg          # or attach to existing tmux
claude-tg               # = claude --strict-mcp-config ; pick a theme on first run
```
The daemon then discovers and adopts the pane (log: `adopted off-MCP pane …`), announces the
session to Telegram, and inbound starts flowing. Note: the *dev/terminal* session you ran the
install from is **not** the bridge target and cannot receive Telegram messages.
**Repo idea:** when a message arrives with no adoptable pane, have the bot reply with a hint
("no active session — launch `claude-tg` in tmux"). Consider detecting the onboarding screen and
surfacing a clearer state than silent non-delivery.

## Final working config (off-MCP)
- Bot **@salahsclaudecode2bot**, locked to Telegram ID `837047563` (allowlist).
- `.env` (chmod 600): token, `TELEGRAM_TRANSCRIPT_OUTBOUND=1`, local Whisper (large-v3-turbo /
  cpu / int8) via the venv python; `access.json`: renderMarkdown + autoContinue on.
- `settings.json`: marketplace + `enabledPlugins` + `SessionStart` ensure-daemon hook. MCP server
  left disabled (`mcp.json.disabled`). `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`: off-MCP convention appended.
- Daemon runs detached from the cache (PPID 1), `polling as @salahsclaudecode2bot`; `tg` CLI on
  PATH; `tg react 0 0 👍` → `chat 0 is not allowlisted` (proves the wire + access gate).
- **Remaining user step:** run `claude-tg` interactively in tmux to give the daemon a pane.
